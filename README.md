## Introduction

This project involves adapting a pretrained T5 model for a new NLP task: scientific question answering. The model, originally trained for housing price prediction, was fine-tuned using a domain-specific dataset to ensure high accuracy and relevance to scientific queries.

## Features

- **Task Adaptation**: Transitioned the model from housing price prediction to scientific question answering.
- **Fine-Tuning Process**: Leveraged a domain-specific dataset to adapt the pretrained model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Used metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's performance.
- **Interpretability**: Visualized attention mechanisms to understand how the model processes scientific queries.

## Technologies Used

- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Model**: T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
- **Libraries**: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook for development and experimentation

## Dataset

The dataset used for fine-tuning was curated from publicly available scientific literature, consisting of question-answer pairs relevant to various domains of science.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and tokenized the dataset for model training.
2. **Model Fine-Tuning**: Trained the T5 model on the scientific question-answer dataset using PyTorch and Hugging Face.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimented with learning rates, batch sizes, and training epochs to optimize performance.
4. **Evaluation**: Validated the model using precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
5. **Interpretability**: Visualized attention mechanisms to enhance understanding of model behavior.
